# RNA 3D Structure Prediction
### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the 3D spatial coordinates of RNA molecules based on their nucleotide sequences. 
By leveraging deep learning and feature engineering techniques, the goal is to enhance the accuracy of structure prediction, 
which is critical for biological research and drug discovery.

### ðŸš€ Datasets
The project utilizes the following datasets:

- __Train Sequences__: Contains RNA sequences associated with unique IDs.
- __Train Labels__: Provides the 3D spatial coordinates (x, y, z) for nucleotide positions.
- __Validation Sequences__: RNA sequences used for validation.
- __Validation Labels__: Corresponding 3D coordinates for validation data.
- __Test Sequences__: RNA sequences used for final testing.
