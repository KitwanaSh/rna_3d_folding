Additional Information:        The T1189/R1189 and T1190/R1190 complexes represent alternative conformations corresponding to different particles in the same cryo-EM data set. The complexes contain one RNA molecule and several (4 or 6) protein molecules. The R1189/T1189 target pair represent the A1B6 complex, while the R1190/T1190 pair - A1B4 complex. Predictions for the corresponding RNA and protein targets should be submitted in the same frame of reference so that the concatenation of corresponding models, say, R1189TS000_1 and T1189TS000_1 will give a coordinate set for the full RNA-protein complex.

Additional Information:        The T1189/R1189 and T1190/R1190 complexes represent alternative conformations corresponding to different particles in the same cryo-EM data set. The complexes contain one RNA molecule and several (4 or 6) protein molecules. The R1189/T1189 target pair represent the A1B6 complex, while the R1190/T1190 pair - A1B4 complex. Predictions for the corresponding RNA and protein targets should be submitted in the same frame of reference so that the concatenation of corresponding models, say, R1189TS000_1 and T1189TS000_1 will give a coordinate set for the full RNA-protein complex.
